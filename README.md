# ⚙️ Flux - A Minimal State Machine Library

**Flux** is a lightweight and type-safe finite state machine.

---

## Installation
You can get Flux from `lib/init.luau` or from [Wally here](https://wally.run/package/cosinewaves/flux).

---

## Demonstration
A small example project using Flux is hosted [here](https://github.com/cosinewaves/flux-demo/tree/main). It uses Flux to handle game states, and dispatches state updates using middleware.
